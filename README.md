# Speech-Synthesis-using-Linear-Predictive-LP-Analysis
Synthesized Vowels by using a periodic triangular pulse train to excite the vocal tract all pole filter model
◦ Applied LPC analysis with orders 2 to 10, showing reduced errors in signal energy with higher orders
◦ Conducted spectral analysis ofpre-emphasized signals to capture formant shaping and lip radiation effects
