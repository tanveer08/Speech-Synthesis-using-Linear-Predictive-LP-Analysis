1. Synthesized Vowels by using a periodic triangular pulse train to excite the vocal tract all pole filter model
2.  Applied LPC analysis with orders 2 to 10, showing reduced errors in signal energy with higher orders
3.  Conducted spectral analysis ofpre-emphasized signals to capture formant shaping and lip radiation effects
